# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that analyzes sensor data from 30 machines, each measuring Pressure and Temperature (60 features total), with a 5-class target variable.
Key Activities:
Data Cleaning: Fixed ~19% missing values using random sampling to preserve distributions

EDA: Analyzed statistics and visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots

Feature Analysis: Found all features have similar statistical properties (uniform distribution)

Class Analysis: Confirmed the 5 target classes are balanced

Visualization: Created clear charts showing data patterns and relationships

Objective:
Prepare sensor data for machine learning by understanding its structure, cleaning issues, and identifying patterns that could help predict machine classes.
